            <ol>
                <li>Graphics fit in very well with the purpose and style of the page.</li>
                <li>The page loads very quickly, even with the many graphics featured on the page.</li>
                <li>Each graphic serves as an elaboration to what the article will be about.</li>
                <li>The featured graphics are not bright or obnoxious, they simply add on to the article's description.</li>
                <li>Some graphics have a few words included in the image to help summarize the preview.</li>
                <li>Every article link has a text description as well as a graphic.</li>
                <li>The graphics that do use text have a very good amout of contrast, making them very easy to read.</li>
